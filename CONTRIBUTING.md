We welcome contributions from the community and value your feedback, comments, and ideas.

1. **Make your changes** with clear, concise commits. Remember to sign off the comment with `-s` flag. For example, `$ git commit -s -m "Add xyz feature"`
1. **Submit a merge request (MR)** with a detailed description of your changes and any relevant context.
